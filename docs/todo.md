- [ ] Sessins in control window should be sorted by:
    - waiting for prompt (orange)
    - working (green)
    - exited (red)
    this also means we need to keep info on dead sessions in memory, which is fine
- [ ] We should track when we started monitoring a session and display for how long it has been running already
- [ ]
- [Â ] Clear all should be "Clear exited".
