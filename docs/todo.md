### Completed
- [x] Clicking on the tray icon should immediately show the control window (no menu). Add a "Shutdown" button in the control window header to quit the daemon, replacing the menu-based quit option.
  - [x] Remove the menu from the tray icon in `setupMenuBar()` (daemon.swift:487-495)
    - Delete lines creating the NSMenu
    - Delete line assigning menu to statusItem
    - Keep the button action and target setup

  - [x] Add Shutdown button to ControlCenterView header (daemon.swift:362)
    - Add button after "Clear Exited" button in same HStack
    - Style with `.buttonStyle(.plain)` and `.font(.caption)`
    - Use red foreground color to indicate destructive action
    - Call the existing `quit()` method or `NSApplication.shared.terminate(nil)`

  - [x] Build the daemon with `npm run build:daemon`
    - Fix any Swift compilation errors

  - [x] Kill existing daemon after build to reload changes
    - Run `pkill -f ClaudeNotifyDaemon`
    - The daemon will auto-restart with new code on next Claude Code command

  - [x] User must test the following before committing:
    - Clicking tray icon shows control window directly (no menu)
    - Toggle behavior works (repeated clicks show/hide window)
    - Shutdown button properly terminates the daemon
    - Socket cleanup occurs (check ~/.claude-notify/notifications.sock is removed)
    - Daemon process exits cleanly

- [x] Sessions in control window should be sorted by:
    - waiting for prompt (orange)
    - working (green)
    - exited (red)
    this also means we need to keep info on dead sessions in memory, which is fine

    **WHAT**:
    - Add a new "exited" state (ðŸ”´ red) for sessions whose processes have ended
    - Keep exited sessions in memory instead of removing them
    - Sort sessions by status: idle (ðŸŸ¡) â†’ working (ðŸŸ¢) â†’ exited (ðŸ”´)
    - Rename "Clear All" to "Clear Exited" and only remove exited sessions
    - No automatic clearing - manual only

    **HOW**:
    - src/mac/daemon.swift:20 - Add `case exited = "exited"` to SessionStatus enum
    - src/mac/daemon.swift:89-107 - Update removeDeadSessions() to mark as exited instead of removing
    - src/mac/daemon.swift:69-71 - Implement sorting by status then timestamp
    - src/mac/daemon.swift:395-397 - Add ðŸ”´ icon for exited status
    - src/mac/daemon.swift:355-357 - Change button to "Clear Exited" with filtered removal
    - src/mac/daemon.swift:109-111 - Update waitingSessionCount to exclude exited
    - src/mac/daemon.swift:483 - Update menu item to "Clear Exited"
    - src/mac/daemon.swift:573-575 - Rename clearAll() to clearExited()
    - src/mac/daemon.swift:422 - Add opacity modifier for visual distinction

### Open
- [ ] When we detect a session has exited, we need to immediately resort the session list
  **WHAT**: When the daemon detects a session has exited (process no longer exists), the session list should immediately resort to move the exited session to the bottom of the list. The resort should happen as soon as the session status is changed to `.exited` in the `removeDeadSessions()` method. The sorting order should remain the same: idle sessions first, working sessions second, exited sessions last (newest first within each group). The UI should update immediately to reflect the new order without waiting for new hook messages.
  
  **HOW**:
  - [x] Extract the sorting logic from `updateSession()` (lines 71-77) into a new private method `sortSessions()` in SessionManager in src/mac/daemon.swift
  - [x] Call `sortSessions()` in `removeDeadSessions()` after marking sessions as exited (after line 107) in src/mac/daemon.swift
  - [x] Add a thread-safe `removeExitedSessions()` method in SessionManager that uses the lock and calls `sortSessions()` in src/mac/daemon.swift
  - [x] Update the "Clear Exited" button action (line 358) to call the new `removeExitedSessions()` method instead of directly modifying sessions in src/mac/daemon.swift
  - [x] Update the clearExited() method (line 580) to use the new thread-safe method in src/mac/daemon.swift
- [ ] We should track when we started monitoring a session and display for how long it has been running already
- [ ] We should be able to say "do not display notifications for this session" in the control window
