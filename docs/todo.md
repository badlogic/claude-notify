- [ ] Make daemon testable
    - special CLI flag in daemon so it can run next to existing daemon with its own socket and own daemon-test.log file
    - tests can write to test socket in ~/.claude-notify/
    - Unsure if there's a better idea?
    - Special commands to open/close control window via socket?
    - snap-happy to take screenshots? better way to test UI?
- [ ] Need to add an icon which we can use for system notifications (if available on the platform)
- [ ] Implement a way to focus the concrete window Claude Code is running in when clicking on a notification or on a session row in the control window
