- [ ] we also want to display something instead of no message when a session is in the working state
- [ ] Make daemon testable
    - special CLI flag in daemon so it can run next to existing daemon with its own socket and own daemon-test.log file
    - tests can write to test socket in ~/.claude-notify/
    - Unsure if there's a better idea?
    - Special commands to open/close control window via socket?
    - snap-happy to take screenshots? better way to test UI?
- [ ] Improve .claude/commands/todo.md
    - todo.md -> only open items, done.md -> finished items, append only, inprogress.md -> in-progress items
    - Improve markdown format of refined todos, look terrible atm, should be nicely formatted nested lists with checkboxes where needed
    - prevent concurrent writes
